{
  "name": "@fanslib/root",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "@fanslib/apps/*",
    "@fanslib/libraries/*",
    "@fanslib/configs/*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "dev": "turbo run dev --parallel",
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "lint": "turbo run lint",
    "typecheck": "turbo run typecheck",
    "storybook": "turbo run storybook"
  }
}
```

**TurboRepo Pipeline Configuration**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#workspace-configuration]

- Build dependencies with proper dependency order
- Development mode with parallel execution
- Test pipeline with build dependencies
- Caching for build outputs and test results

### File Locations

Based on the unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- **Root Configuration**: `package.json`, `turbo.json`, `bun.lockb`
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/` directory
- **Apps**: `@fanslib/apps/web/`, `@fanslib/apps/server/`
- **UI**: `@fanslib/apps/web/src/components/ui/` (integrated design system)
- **Configs**: `@fanslib/configs/eslint/`, `@fanslib/configs/typescript/`, `@fanslib/configs/prettier/`

### Environment Setup Requirements

**Development Environment**: [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#local-development-setup]

- Bun installation required as primary runtime and package manager
- Docker and Docker Compose for database services (PostgreSQL, ElectricSQL)
- Environment variables configuration via `.env.example` template

**Initial Setup Commands**: [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#local-development-setup]

```bash
bun install                    # Install all workspace dependencies
bun run build                  # Build shared libraries and configs
bun run dev                    # Start all services in parallel
```

### Technical Constraints

- **Bun Runtime**: All backend code must be compatible with Bun runtime
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All packages must compile with strict TypeScript settings
- **Workspace Dependencies**: Cross-package references must use workspace protocol
- **Build Order**: Libraries and configs must build before apps that depend on them

### Testing

#### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Organization**:

- **Frontend Tests**: `@fanslib/apps/web/tests/` - Minimal utility testing only
- **Backend Tests**: `@fanslib/apps/server/tests/` - Focus on business logic modules
- **E2E Tests**: `tests/e2e/` - Complete user workflow testing

**Testing Frameworks**:

- **Vitest Configuration**: `@fanslib/apps/web/vitest.config.ts` with jsdom environment
- **Bun Test**: Built-in testing for backend modules and utilities
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing with browser automation

**Test File Locations**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

- Frontend utils tests: `apps/web/tests/utils/`
- Backend logic tests: `apps/server/tests/modules/`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` (root level)
- Test setup files: `tests/setup.ts` in respective packages

**Testing Philosophy**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-approach]
Focus on high-value tests that catch real bugs, avoid over-testing for personal-use application. Priority order: E2E Tests (High Value) → Backend Logic Tests (Medium Value) → Frontend Utils Tests (Low Priority).

2. `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` - Updated console.log guidelines for backend packages

**Note**: Dev should update File List to include new E2E test file.

### Architectural Changes Made

**Consolidation of UI Library and Storybook into Web Package** (September 15, 2025)

The monorepo architecture has been simplified by consolidating the separate `@fanslib/ui` library and `@fanslib/storybook` packages into the main `@fanslib/web` package. This change provides:

- **Simplified Development**: Single package for frontend development, UI components, and component documentation
- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer workspace dependencies and build configurations to maintain
- **Faster Iteration**: Direct access to UI components without workspace linking overhead
- **Integrated Workflow**: Storybook development alongside main application development

**Files Moved/Modified:**

- `@fanslib/libraries/ui/src/*` → `@fanslib/apps/web/src/components/ui/`
- `@fanslib/apps/storybook/*` → `@fanslib/apps/web/stories/` and `@fanslib/apps/web/.storybook/`
- Updated `@fanslib/apps/web/package.json` with Storybook dependencies and scripts
- Updated architecture documentation to reflect the new consolidated structure

**Packages Removed:**

- `@fanslib/libraries/ui/` (consolidated into web)
- `@fanslib/apps/storybook/` (consolidated into web)
- `@fanslib/configs/tailwind/` (configuration moved directly into web package)

This architectural shift maintains all functionality while providing a simpler, more maintainable structure for the development team.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-infrastructure-setup.yml

### Recommended Status

✅ **Ready for Done**

**Rationale**: Infrastructure foundation is excellent with proper monorepo structure, tooling configuration, and development workflow established. CI/CD pipeline is adequate for current development needs. Testing approach correctly follows the minimal testing philosophy. Only minor Storybook issues remain, which are acceptable for MVP and can be addressed in future iterations when component documentation becomes a priority.

**Quality Score**: 90/100 - Excellent infrastructure implementation ready for feature development.
