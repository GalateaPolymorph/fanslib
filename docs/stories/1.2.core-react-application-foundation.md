**TanStack Router Configuration**:
- File-based routing with `src/routes/` directory structure
- Type-safe route definitions with automatic TypeScript generation
- Route-based code splitting and lazy loading for performance
- Built-in search parameter validation with Zod schemas
- Nested route layouts with data loading and error boundaries
- Router devtools integration for development debugging

### Component Architecture Patterns

**Component Template Pattern**: [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Presentational Components**: Pure UI with props, no business logic
- **Container Components**: Data-connected with business logic (future stories)
- **Layout Components**: Application shell and navigation structure with TanStack Router outlets
- **Route Components**: Type-safe route handlers with TanStack Router integration
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling for component failures

### Error Handling Requirements

**Error Boundary Implementation**: [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- **Component-level boundaries**: For each major feature area
- **Error logging**: With correlation IDs and structured format
- **User-friendly fallbacks**: Clear error messages without technical jargon
- **Effect types**: Use Effect.ts Effect types for error-prone operations

**Error Boundary Locations**: [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- ContentBrowserErrorBoundary (media scanning, display failures)
- PostCompositionErrorBoundary (form validation, save failures)
- SchedulingErrorBoundary (calendar operations, batch scheduling)
- TaggingErrorBoundary (tag operations, dimension management)

### Responsive Design Requirements

**Breakpoint Configuration**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Mobile**: 320px-767px (touch-friendly interface)
- **Tablet**: 768px-1023px (hybrid interface)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (full feature interface)

**Navigation Patterns**: [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Desktop**: Sidebar navigation with persistent visibility
- **Mobile**: Hamburger menu with drawer/modal pattern
- **Responsive**: DaisyUI navbar and drawer components

### Build Configuration

**Build Configuration**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Hot module replacement enabled
- TypeScript compilation with strict mode
- TanStack Router automatic route generation
- Tailwind CSS processing
- Asset optimization and bundling

**Development Environment**: [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Development server on localhost:3001
- TypeScript strict mode compilation with TanStack Router type generation
- ESLint and Prettier integration
- Source map generation for debugging
- TanStack Router devtools for route debugging and navigation analysis
- Automatic route type generation on file changes

### Technical Constraints

**TypeScript Requirements**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Strict mode**: All strict type checking options enabled
- **Named exports**: Never use default exports
- **Functional components**: No class components, hooks for state
- **Arrow functions**: Preferred over function keyword

**Functional Programming**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **No loops**: Use array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- **Immutable style**: Never mutate variables after initialization
- **Effect types**: Use Effect.ts for error handling (future stories)

### Testing

#### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Frontend Testing Approach**: Minimal utility testing only, skip component testing for personal-use application

**Test Organization**:
- **Location**: `@fanslib/apps/web/tests/`
- **Focus**: Only complex utility functions, avoid component testing overhead
- **Framework**: Vitest with jsdom environment for utilities

**Error Boundary Testing**: Basic smoke tests to ensure error boundaries render fallback UI correctly

**Build Verification**: Ensure application builds and starts without errors in CI pipeline

**Testing Philosophy**: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
Focus on high-value tests that catch real bugs, avoid over-testing for personal-use application. Component testing is skipped due to maintenance overhead, React's built-in safety is sufficient.
