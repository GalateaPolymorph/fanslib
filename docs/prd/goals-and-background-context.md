## Background Context

FansLib addresses the critical workflow challenges faced by solo adult content creators who manage content distribution across multiple platforms. Currently, creators spend 30-40% of their time on administrative tasks due to fragmented workflows: disorganized content libraries, manual platform management, inefficient content discovery, and lack of cross-platform intelligence.

The platform transforms chaotic creator workflows into organized, strategic operations by serving as a centralized, intelligent content management system. Built by and for a solo adult content creator, FansLib provides platform-agnostic content intelligence with platform-specific optimization features, enabling creators to maximize their content's potential through smart organization, strategic scheduling, and workflow automation tailored specifically to adult content creation needs across platforms like Fansly, ManyVids, Reddit, Bluesky, Redgifs, and Clips4Sale.
