# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Content Management

**Expanded Goal**: Establish robust project infrastructure including monorepo setup, core React application, basic content library functionality, and shoot-based content organization. This epic delivers immediate value by enabling content import, basic organization, and visual browsing while establishing the technical foundation for all subsequent features.

## Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup

_As a developer, I want a properly configured monorepo with all necessary tooling, so that I can develop features efficiently with consistent code quality._

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Monorepo structure created with apps/, libs/, and configs/ folders
2. Bun workspace configuration implemented with TurboRepo optimization
3. TypeScript configuration shared across all packages via configs/
4. ESLint and Prettier configurations implemented and enforced
5. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured for automated testing
6. Test-driven development setup with testing framework configured
7. Storybook configuration for isolated component development and documentation
8. Basic package.json scripts for development, build, and test workflows

## Story 1.2: Core React Application Foundation

_As a content creator, I want a functional web application with basic navigation, so that I can access the FansLib content management interface._

### Acceptance Criteria

1. React application created in apps/ folder with TypeScript
2. Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI component library integrated
3. Basic application shell with navigation structure
4. Responsive design foundation supporting desktop, tablet, and mobile
5. Error boundaries implemented for graceful error handling in React components
6. Basic routing structure for main application sections
7. Application successfully builds and runs in development mode

## Story 1.3: AI Development Agent Integration

_As a developer, I want AI development agents to access the running application through Playwright MCP server, so that agents can interact with the application for testing and development assistance._

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Playwright MCP server configured and accessible to AI development agents
2. Application startup scripts that enable agent access to running instance
3. Basic Playwright test configuration for application interaction
4. MCP server endpoints properly exposed for agent communication
5. Documentation for AI agents on how to access and interact with the application
6. Integration with development workflow for seamless agent assistance
7. Proper security configuration for development environment access

## Story 1.4: Content Library File System Scanning

_As a content creator, I want the system to automatically discover and catalog my existing content library with shoot-based organization, so that I can immediately browse and work with my organized media files in FansLib._

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Content library bound to local file system via volume mount (Docker deployment level)
2. Automatic scanning of bound content directory for supported image and video formats
3. Basic file validation and error handling during scanning process
4. File path storage and tracking for each discovered media item
5. Thumbnail generation for all discovered images and videos
6. File metadata extraction (size, dimensions, creation date) during scan
7. Automatic shoot creation from folders matching YYYY-MM-DD\_<NAME> format during scan
8. Assignment of media items to auto-detected shoots based on folder structure
9. Import of content not matching shoot folder format without shoot assignment
10. Initial full scan on application startup
11. Scan progress indicators and success/error feedback in UI

## Story 1.5: File System Change Monitoring

_As a content creator, I want the system to automatically detect when I rename, move, or delete files in my content library, so that FansLib stays synchronized with my file system changes._

### Acceptance Criteria

1. File system change monitoring implementation for the bound content directory
2. Detection of renamed files with automatic path updates in media library
3. Detection of moved files with automatic path updates in media library
4. Detection of deleted files with automatic removal from media library
5. Detection of new files with automatic addition to media library
6. Incremental thumbnail generation for newly detected files
7. Real-time UI updates reflecting file system changes
8. Error handling for file system monitoring failures

## Story 1.6: Visual Content Browser

_As a content creator, I want to browse my content using thumbnails, so that I can quickly identify and select specific media items._

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Thumbnail grid view displaying all scanned content
2. Hover effects and selection states for media items
3. Multi-select functionality with checkboxes or click+modifier keys
4. Basic content information overlay (filename, shoot, date)
5. Grid size options (small, medium, large thumbnails)
6. Infinite scroll or pagination for large content libraries
7. Loading states and error handling for thumbnail display
8. Responsive grid layout adapting to screen size
9. Action bar that appears when items are selected

## Story 1.7: Manual Shoot Management via Action Bar

_As a content creator, I want to manage shoots through the visual browser's action bar, so that I can organize content that wasn't automatically assigned and refine my shoot organization._

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Action bar displays when content items are multi-selected in visual browser
2. "Assign to Shoot" action in action bar with shoot selection dropdown
3. "Create New Shoot" option within assignment workflow
4. Shoot creation interface with name and metadata (date, description)
5. Batch assignment of selected items to chosen shoot
6. Visual feedback showing successful assignment
7. Basic shoot filtering and selection capabilities for browsing organized content
8. Reassignment workflow for moving content between existing shoots

## Story 1.8: Content Search and Filtering

_As a content creator, I want to search and filter my content using sophisticated filter logic, so that I can find specific items within 30 seconds and have a foundation for complex future filtering._

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Text search functionality across filenames and basic metadata
2. Shoot-based filtering dropdown
3. Date range filtering capabilities
4. File type filtering (images, videos)
5. Advanced filter engine supporting AND groups, OR groups, and NOT modifiers
6. Filter combination interface allowing complex logical queries
7. Clear filter indicators
8. Filter state persistence and clear filter reset functionality
9. Search performance under 2 seconds for libraries up to 1000 items
10. Extensible filter architecture ready for custom tag dimensions in Epic 5
