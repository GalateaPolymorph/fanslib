# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

FansLib prioritizes **efficiency and visual clarity** for rapid content management workflows. The interface emphasizes **thumbnail-rich browsing** with powerful filtering capabilities, enabling creators to quickly identify, organize, and schedule content. The design follows a **dashboard-centric approach** where all critical information (content status, platform coverage, content runway) is visible at a glance, minimizing context switching and maximizing workflow velocity.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Visual-First Content Discovery**: Thumbnail grids with overlay indicators for posting status and tag information
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple views by default with expandable detail panels for advanced operations
- **Seamless Library-to-Schedule Workflow**: Direct drag-and-drop from content library to calendar scheduling with multi-select support
- **Batch Operation Workflows**: Multi-select interfaces with bulk actions for efficient content management
- **Contextual Filtering**: Always-accessible filter panels that update results in real-time
- **Status-Driven Navigation**: Visual indicators guide users to content requiring attention or action

## Core Screens and Views

- **Content Library Dashboard**: Primary thumbnail grid with filtering sidebar, status overview, and multi-select capabilities for seamless scheduling workflow
- **Integrated Scheduling Interface**: Unified view combining content library with calendar-based scheduling, enabling direct drag-and-drop of multi-selected content items to create posts
- **Content Detail View**: Individual media item with full metadata, tagging interface, and posting history
- **Tag Dimension Management**: Configuration interface for creating and managing custom tag dimensions
- **Platform Status Dashboard**: Cross-platform overview showing posting schedules and content runway
- **Content Import/Organization**: Shoot-based import workflow with batch tagging capabilities
- **Post Management View**: Interface for creating and managing post entities containing multiple media items
- **Post Composition Interface**: Title and caption creation with hashtag support, default hashtag insertion, and text snippet management

## Accessibility: None

Accessibility compliance is not a priority for this personal-use application. Standard web accessibility practices may be considered for future enhancement but are not required for MVP implementation.

## Branding

Clean, professional interface optimized for content creator workflows. Design emphasizes **visual hierarchy** and **information density balanced with visual clarity** appropriate for power users who prefer simplified interfaces. Color coding and visual indicators support rapid status recognition and workflow efficiency.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Full functionality across **desktop, tablet, and mobile devices** with responsive design ensuring complete feature access on all screen sizes. Primary optimization for desktop workflows while maintaining full mobile capability for comprehensive on-the-go content management.

## UX Design Tasks

The following areas require UX design expertise to develop optimal solutions:

- **Information Density vs. Visual Clarity Balance**: Develop thumbnail view concept that provides sufficient information for power users while maintaining visual simplicity and clarity
- **Filter Panel Layout Optimization**: Design complex tag dimension filtering interface that remains intuitive and efficient for multi-dimensional queries
- **Mobile Experience Design**: Create responsive layouts that provide full functionality while optimizing for touch interactions and smaller screen constraints
- **Seamless Library-to-Schedule Integration**: Design intuitive workflow for multi-selecting content items in library view and drag-and-drop scheduling to calendar, including visual feedback and post creation flow
- **Unified Interface Architecture**: Develop layout that seamlessly integrates content browsing with scheduling functionality without overwhelming the user interface
