# Next Steps

## Design Handoff Checklist

- [x] All user flows documented (bulk scheduling, content tagging, content discovery, post management)
- [x] Component inventory complete (Daisy UI + Radix UI + custom components approach defined)
- [x] Accessibility requirements defined (accessibility is not a priority for this personal use application)
- [x] Responsive strategy clear (desktop-first with full mobile functionality)
- [x] Brand guidelines incorporated (FansLib theme with Nunito Sans and Lucide Icons)
- [x] Performance goals established (20-second content discovery, bulk operation optimization)

## Design Evolution Notes

This specification provides the foundation for FansLib's user experience while allowing for iterative refinement during development. The component-driven approach with Storybook enables rapid prototyping and testing of interface patterns specific to content management workflows.

Additional screens and detailed mockups will be created on-demand as development progresses, ensuring the design evolves based on actual usage patterns rather than theoretical assumptions.
