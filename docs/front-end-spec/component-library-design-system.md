# Component Library / Design System

**Design System Approach:** Hybrid approach using Daisy UI as the foundational component system with Radix UI or React-Aria for accessible unstyled components when needed, extended with custom Tailwind CSS components for FansLib-specific workflows. This leverages proven design patterns while allowing for specialized content management interface components.

**Component Development Strategy:**

- **Clear separation of concerns:** Distinct presentational components isolated from business logic and data dependencies
- **Storybook integration:** Component development environment for building and testing components in isolation
- **Progressive enhancement:** Components support both simple and advanced usage patterns
- **Consistent visual language:** Unified approach to status indicators, selection states, and drag-drop interactions

**Component Library Stack:**

- **Daisy UI:** Primary component library for forms, buttons, navigation, and standard UI elements
- **Radix UI / React-Aria:** Accessible unstyled components for complex interactions and custom styling needs
- **Custom Tailwind Components:** Content management specific components (thumbnails, filters, drag zones, etc.)
- **Storybook:** Component development and documentation environment

**Development Guidelines:**

- Components should be data-agnostic and highly reusable
- All interactive components must support keyboard navigation
- Status indicators and visual feedback should be consistent across similar component types
- Drag-and-drop interactions should follow consistent visual patterns
