# Wireframes & Mockups

**Primary Design Files:** Design-as-you-build approach using component libraries and rapid prototyping rather than extensive upfront wireframing

## Key Screen Layouts

**Screen 1: Integrated Calendar Workspace**

**Purpose:** Primary bulk scheduling environment supporting 2-4 hour scheduling sessions

**Key Elements:**

- Collapsible content library panel (left) with filtering and multi-select
- Full calendar view (right) with virtual schedule slots as drop zones
- Persistent action bar showing current selection count and bulk actions
- Content runway indicators integrated into calendar headers
- Quick post preview capabilities

**Interaction Notes:** Split-screen layout optimizes for drag-drop workflows while maintaining visual context of both content and schedule

**Screen 2: Content Library with Tagging Interface**

**Purpose:** Primary content discovery and tagging workflow environment

**Key Elements:**

- Thumbnail grid with adjustable sizing and density
- Advanced filter panel with tag dimensions, date ranges, and logical operators
- Content detail preview pane (expandable)
- Batch tagging interface with tag dimension panels
- Visual status indicators (posted/scheduled/available) on thumbnails

**Interaction Notes:** Optimized for keyboard navigation and rapid tagging workflows with immediate visual feedback

**Screen 3: Post Detail Screen (Dedicated)**

**Purpose:** Comprehensive post editing environment

**Key Elements:**

- Media list view with reordering capability (no carousel)
- Full caption editor with hashtag highlighting and snippet insertion
- Channel-specific settings panel
- Posting history and analytics section
- Clear action buttons (save, delete, duplicate, schedule)

**Interaction Notes:** Dedicated full-screen design providing complete editing capabilities with clear navigation back to calendar context

**Screen 4: Media Detail Page**

**Purpose:** Comprehensive individual media item management and information view

**Key Elements:**

- Full media preview (large image/video player)
- Complete metadata display (filename, file size, dimensions, creation date, file path)
- Shoot assignment and management (current shoot, reassign options)
- Tag dimension interface (view and edit all tag assignments)
- Posting history table (posts this media appears in, channels, dates, URLs)
- Content eligibility indicators (which schedules/channels this media qualifies for)
- Media actions (delete from library, delete from disk, duplicate detection)
- Content relationships (similar items, same shoot items)
- Free preview designation toggle (if used in posts)

**Interaction Notes:** Dedicated full-screen view optimized for detailed media inspection and comprehensive metadata management. Navigation between media items within current filter context.

**Design Development Notes:** Additional screens and detailed mockups will be created on-demand during development as specific interface needs are identified. This approach allows for iterative refinement based on actual usage patterns rather than extensive upfront speculation.
