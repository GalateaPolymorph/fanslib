# Responsiveness Strategy

**Responsive Design Philosophy:** Desktop-first optimization with basic mobile functionality. Mobile serves as a content viewing and basic management interface - functional but not optimized for complex workflows. This approach prioritizes development efficiency while ensuring the application remains accessible on mobile devices.

## Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices                     | Feature Set |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Mobile     | 320px     | 767px     | Smartphones                        | Basic       |
| Tablet     | 768px     | 1023px    | Tablets, small laptops             | Full        |
| Desktop    | 1024px    | 1439px    | Standard desktops, laptops         | Full        |
| Wide       | 1440px    | -         | Large monitors, ultrawide displays | Full        |
