# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **FansLib Content Management Platform**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** **Build from scratch** - Greenfield project with clearly defined technical stack preferences

Based on your PRD and technical preferences, this is a greenfield project with specific technology requirements that are best served by building from scratch:

- **Monorepo structure** using Bun workspace management and TurboRepo
- **TypeScript, React, Bun, TurboRepo** as mandatory technical preferences
- **Tanstack Start** for routing
- **Tanstack DB** for data layer
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle** for database and migrations/schema layer
- **Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI** for styling and components
- **Storybook integration** for isolated component development and documentation
- **Functional programming principles** with pure functions
- **Test-driven development** approach
- **Self-hosted Docker deployment** on Unraid server

**Rationale for building from scratch:**

- Adult content management workflows require specialized features not found in generic templates
- Self-hosted deployment with Docker on Unraid needs custom configuration
- Complete control over architecture decisions ensures optimal performance for media-heavy operations

## Database & Development Tooling Decisions

- **Storybook:** Component development environment enabling isolated UI component development and comprehensive documentation, essential for maintaining design system consistency across the monorepo
