_Captured during Project Brief creation - 2025-09-12_

## Content Lifecycle Intelligence (Phase 2)

- **Content Performance Tracking**: Track which posts performed well where for repost prioritization
- **Platform-Specific Optimization Reminders**: "This performed well on Fansly, consider reposting to OnlyFans"
- **Performance-Based Repost Logic**: Smart suggestions based on actual engagement data
- **Audience Preference Learning**: Track which content types perform best on each platform and suggest optimization strategies
- **Repost Readiness Signals**: Smart indicators showing when content is ready for strategic reposts based on time elapsed and platform rules
- **Advanced Content Runway Analytics**: Enhanced projections with burn rate analysis, predictive modeling, and sophisticated planning alerts beyond basic MVP calculation

## Shoot Planning & Content Creation Pipeline (Phase 2)

- **Pre-Shoot Planning**: Outfit planning, location scouting, concept development
- **Shoot Execution Tracking**: What was actually captured vs. planned
- **Post-Shoot Processing**: Editing queue, content categorization, initial tagging
- **Content Release Strategy**: How to distribute shoot content across time/platforms
- **Full Integration**: Replace separate shoot tracking tool with integrated workflow

## Content Management Enhancements (Phase 2)

- **Manual Content Retirement**: Allow manual flagging of older content that no longer meets quality standards
- **Quality Evolution Tracking**: System awareness of content quality improvements over time
- **Advanced Content Variations**: Platform-specific content modifications (if needed in future)
- **Automated Compliance Checking**: Ensure content meets platform-specific requirements before posting (already in prototype)

## Technical Notes

- Cross-platform content can be largely identical (simplifies MVP)
- No automatic content retirement needed
- Build on existing prototype foundation
- Current workflow: External shoot tracking → Content import → FansLib management

## MVP Focus Areas (Current Phase)

- Content management foundation
- Scheduling system
- Basic posting history tracking
- Platform-agnostic organization with platform-specific features
- **Multi-Dimensional Filtering**: Advanced search with AND/OR groups and NOT modifiers (already in prototype)
- **Basic Content Runway Display**: Simple days/weeks remaining calculation per platform
